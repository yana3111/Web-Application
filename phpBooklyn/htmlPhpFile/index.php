        <p>William Strunk Jr. was a professor of English at Cornell University and, together with E.B. White, author of The Elements of Style (1918). Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts.
